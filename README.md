# What I find Interesting

I choose one of my favorite articles by Moxie Marlinspike. He has done a lot of cool cryptography stuff (e.g. creation of Signal/Signal Protocol, Convergence, Head of Security at Twitter), and I thought that his comments on web3 would be especially interesting. I thought that his practical approach to thinking about the viability of web3 in opposition to usual idealist view that exists in many crypto circles. He also brings up the reliance on centralized servers that these theoretical distributed systems are supposed to have. 

Ultimately, he makes the argument that the privacy bar of web3 is pretty low and actually arguably lower than web2. The technology seems pretty neat, but ultimately is bringing people in because it is a new technology to get excited about. The fundamental arguments that people are not going to want to run their own servers and that the burden of creating software should be lowered instead of increased, I believe hold true.

I really like what you found intresting about the article especially the concept that many people are becoming intrested in web3 because it is new tech to get excited about, and maybe even a trend in some aspects. Great Job! - Niel
